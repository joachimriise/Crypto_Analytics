# Quick Start Guide

## Setup in 30 Seconds

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to the provided URL.

### 2. Wait 10-15 Seconds

The dashboard will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Detect empty database
- ‚úÖ Fetch live crypto prices from CoinGecko
- ‚úÖ Collect market data
- ‚úÖ Generate BUY/SELL recommendations
- ‚úÖ Display everything

**That's it!** No buttons to click, no configuration needed.

## What You'll See

### Live Dashboard
- **Buy Opportunities** (Green Cards) - Cryptocurrencies recommended for purchase
- **Sell Signals** (Red Cards) - Cryptocurrencies recommended for selling
- **Live Price Grid** - Real-time prices for top 10 cryptos
- **News Feed** - Financial news with sentiment scores
- **Market Overview** - S&P 500 index showing market conditions
- **Auto-Refresh** - Updates every 5 minutes automatically

### Each Recommendation Includes:
- **Action**: BUY, SELL, or HOLD
- **Confidence**: 50-95% certainty
- **Reasoning**: Clear explanation of why
- **Target Price**: Expected price goal
- **Stop Loss**: Risk management level

## Auto-Refresh System

The dashboard automatically refreshes every 5 minutes:
1. Fetches latest crypto prices
2. Collects new financial news
3. Re-analyzes market conditions
4. Updates recommendations

**Manual Refresh:** Click the "Refresh" button in the top-right for immediate update.

## Optional: Load Historical Data

For 5 years of price history (optional, not required):

```bash
npm run setup
```

This runs once and takes 30-45 minutes due to API rate limits.

**When to use this:**
- You want deeper historical analysis
- You're testing recommendation accuracy over time
- You want to backtest the system

**When to skip this:**
- Just want current recommendations (most users)
- Want to get started immediately
- Don't need historical context

- **Target Price**: Typically +15% above current price
- **Stop Loss**: Typically -8% below current price
- **Confidence**: 60-95%

### SELL Signal (Red Cards)
- **Triggers**: Negative news + price decline + market downturn
- **Stop Loss**: Limit further losses

## Optional: Add API Keys for Enhanced Features

The system works perfectly without any API keys using CoinGecko (free, unlimited for basic usage).

For additional features, get free API keys:

### Alpha Vantage (S&P 500 Real Data)
1. Get key: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key
2. Open `src/lib/api/alpha-vantage.ts`
3. Replace `const API_KEY = 'demo';` with your key

### NewsAPI (Real Financial News)
1. Get key: https://newsapi.org/register
2. Open `src/lib/api/newsapi.ts`
3. Replace `const API_KEY = 'demo';` with your key

**Without these keys:**
- ‚úÖ Real crypto prices (CoinGecko)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sample news articles
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sample S&P 500 data

**With these keys:**
- ‚úÖ Real crypto prices
- ‚úÖ Real financial news
- ‚úÖ Real S&P 500 data

## Troubleshooting

**Dashboard shows "Loading..." forever?**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify `.env` file has Supabase credentials
- Wait 30 seconds (first load can be slow)

**No recommendations showing?**
- Wait 15-20 seconds for initial data collection
- Check that crypto prices loaded (scroll down to price grid)
- Click manual "Refresh" button

**Recommendations seem outdated?**
- Check "Last updated" timestamp in top-right
- Click "Refresh" button for immediate update
- System auto-refreshes every 5 minutes

**Want to restart fresh?**
- Clear the Supabase database tables
- Reload the page
- System will re-fetch all data automatically

## How It Works

### On First Load:
1. Dashboard checks if `crypto_prices` table is empty
2. If empty: Automatically runs `collectAndGenerate()`
3. Fetches live prices from CoinGecko API
4. Collects latest news
5. Generates recommendations based on analysis
6. Displays everything

### Every 5 Minutes:
1. Auto-refresh timer triggers
2. Fetches updated prices
3. Collects new news
4. Re-generates recommendations
5. Updates display
6. Updates "Last updated" timestamp

### Manual Refresh:
1. Click "Refresh" button
2. Same process as auto-refresh
3. Immediate update without waiting

## Data Architecture

**Database Tables:**
- `crypto_prices` - Live and historical price data
- `news_events` - Financial news with sentiment scores
- `recommendations` - Active BUY/SELL/HOLD signals
- `market_indices` - S&P 500 and market data
- `api_usage_logs` - API call tracking

**All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled.**

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is NOT financial advice**
- Educational and analytical tool only
- Always do your own research
- Past performance ‚â† future results
- Consider your risk tolerance

‚úÖ **All crypto data is real**
- Live prices from CoinGecko API
- Real market caps and volumes
- Actual 24-hour changes

üîÑ **Auto-updating system**
- No manual intervention needed
- Runs continuously in background
- Always shows current recommendations

## Next Steps

1. **Watch Recommendations**: Monitor BUY/SELL signals on dashboard
2. **Check Reasoning**: Read why each recommendation was made
3. **Track Performance**: See how recommendations perform over time
4. **Customize**: Edit `src/lib/constants.ts` to add more cryptos
5. **Enhance**: Add API keys for real news and market data

## Support

The system is designed to be fully automatic. If something isn't working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection in `.env`
3. Try manual refresh button
4. Restart the dev server (`npm run dev`)
