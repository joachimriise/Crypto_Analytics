## To Add Data & See Your Dashboard

### One Command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**That's it!** The system does everything automatically:

1. Opens in your browser
2. Detects empty database
3. Fetches live crypto prices from CoinGecko
4. Generates BUY/SELL recommendations
5. Shows your dashboard in 10-15 seconds

## What You'll See

- **Green Cards** = BUY recommendations
- **Red Cards** = SELL recommendations
- **Live Prices** for top 10 cryptocurrencies
- **News Feed** with sentiment analysis
- **Auto-Updates** every 5 minutes

## Optional: Historical Data

Want 5 years of price history? Run once:

```bash
npm run setup
```

Takes 30-45 minutes. Most users don't need this.
